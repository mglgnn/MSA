# MSA : phylodist
The code is under construction. Currently, it allows to read a tree in Newick format from a string and extract the phylogenetic tree it defines. The distance is then computed between any desired pairs of species on the base of branch distances provided as input. 

Todo: 

group functions relating tree construction, visiting, etc into a class 

allow to extract subtrees and rescale distances accordingly
